# SeqFISH pipeline

###Description of the pipeline

Our pipeline is a **MatlabÂ®** and **R** based pipeline that performs all the basic steps of seqFISH and smFISH data analysis, namely :
- Image cleaning and pre-processing.
- Automated spot detection/localisation.
- Automated cell detection and segmentation.
- Image stitching and alignment across multiple rounds.

The whole pipeline can be run in an automated manner if the data quality is high enough.
